                <h2 class="heading1" style="color: azure; text-align: center;">How do you join La Masia soccer academy?</h2>
                <p class="responsive" style="color: aliceblue;"> First off, you‚Äôve got to be selected by a Barcelona scout, who travel all over the world looking for the best young soccer players.
                    And that‚Äôs also a key factor, most of the players selected for La Masia are between 6-11 years old, the coaches and trainers at Barcelona are looking for young talent with great potential. Also, a majority of the players chosen for Barcelona‚Äôs youth academy are from Spain and the Catalonia region, where La Masia is located.
                    While joing or being selected to attend La Masia is extremely difficult, it is possible to attend Barcelona soccer camps, which they hold all over the world and in the United States.
                    La Masia was created in 1979 as the place where Barcelona could develop young soccer players, it is both a school in the academic sense and a place where young players can learn the Barcelona system and, hopefully, play for the first team one day at the Camp Nou infront of 90,000 Barca fans. <br> <br> ‚ÄúYoungsters need opportunities ? everyone needs time,‚Äù former Barcelona player Guillermo Amor told The Associated Press. ‚ÄúWith all conditions being equal, a homegrown player has a better chance than one who comes in from abroad. The Xavis and Iniestas took 10 years to get to where they are.‚ÄùThe school trains over 300 select players, with some living in La Masia houses, others in housing near the stadium, and the rest living in and Barcelona in their own housing.Much of the success of Barcelona has been attributed to the building up of one concept of play. All young players learn the idea of total football, where players can move from one position to another. And, to the idea of one and two touch passing, which is also know as the?tiki taka style of play. </p>

                    60 Minutes does a feature story on what is now known is one of the greatest teams of all time, Barcelona, with the likes of Messi, Iniesta, Xavi, and Fabregas. All players who developed their skills at the famed Barcelona youth soccer school,?La Masia.
                    
                    I was hoping they might interview Carlos Puyol a little bit, who‚Äôs fight and energy really has been the engine for Barcelona the past few years. Yes, their ability to keep the ball for nearly 70% of the match and score marvelous goals in a?tiki taka style?is a big part of it, but they still need the anchor in the back.

                <p class="p3"> <span class="heading3">La Masia</span> <br><br>  La Masia de Can Planes, usually shortened to La Masia (Catalan pronunciation: [l…ô m…ôÀàzi.…ô]; English: "The Farmhouse"),[1] is a term used for FC Barcelona's youth academy. The academy includes more than 300 young players. It has been an instrumental factor in Barcelona's European success, and produced several world class players in the early 2000s.

                    In 2010, La Masia became the first youth academy to have trained all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or in a single year: Andr√©s Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Xavi.[2]
                    
                    La Masia is also the name of FC Barcelona's football training facilities, originally located near the Spotify Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In Catalan: masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the academy players. In a simple ceremony, the doors were closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over the function of the residential center for the players. </p>
